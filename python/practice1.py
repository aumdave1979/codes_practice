name = "Aum,dimple"
 #line 34 is often called slicing
print(name[0:5]) #in this the print function will only print from 1 upto 4th index the and will not prnt the 5th index element
    #negative slicing
print(name[0:-1]) #means it will take as len(name)-1 means 10-1 so 9 so it will print "Aum,dimpl"
